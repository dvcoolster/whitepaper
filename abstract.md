# Abstract

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been around for close to a decade. We have not yet gone beyond the early adopters \(&lt;1%\) and taken off in masses. There are several challenges that we have identified for the same. We believe this is not just a technological scale challenge, but also a product and community challenge. This is what Opoch aims to solve.

For billions of users, Opoch is the mobile app that connects them with peers for exchanging fiat with crypto assets without any 3rd party intermediary. It is steered by its own open platform empowering developers to further propel the crypto ecosystem.

For businesses, Opoch offers a collection of Business Smart-Contracts \(BSCs\), helping them setup payment channels as desired. Payments thus solved globally, along with the Opoch gateway app, enable markets and opportunities that are non-existent currently.
