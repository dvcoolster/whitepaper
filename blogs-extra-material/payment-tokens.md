# Payment Tokens

Apart from Opoch Token two tokens are important to mention here:

Ether: Most of the business would might prefer to take payments in ether as it being the base currency for the erc20 tokens. Though ether not being erc20 token, allowing smart-contract to deduct automatically is not possible. We can use wrapped ether \(similar to how 0x uses it\) for this purpose \[\[ix\]\]. Wrapped ether or weth is ether converted to erc20 tokens with same value.Stable Coins \[\[x\]\]: Another difficulty for business to take payment in cryptocurrency is volatility they have. Business generally do not want to be in position where they cannot predict their cash flows. Fiat pegged stable coins can be used to enable the payments as well staying away from volatility.
