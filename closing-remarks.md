# Closing Remarks

When we look at the _history of **Internet**_, it communicated 1% of Global telecommunication by 1993, 51% by 2000, and 97% by 2007. We know how it has shaped us as humanity. 

Web 3.0 is on a similar path, but the future does not build itself. _Today, crypto adoption is at less than 1%_.

So, for now, itâ€™s vital to focus on growing adoption as it increases the overall value creation and unites crypto community as a whole towards the singular goal of creating a better future, together.

That's step one from here for the true information age, Opoch age. 

We are building Opoch so that whenever someone asks you, '_What is Bitcoin?_'' or '_What are Cryptocurrencies_?', you just have to redirect them to downloading the Opoch app, and we'll do out best to have one more individual on the Crypto bandwagon.

Opoch is being built as the breeding ground of community evangelists. As product is an evolving phenomenon, we'll be building closely with selected communities to fine tune the product for their requirements. As product stabilises we'll be able to open up global geographies and customise accordingly. As we do not hold any assets with us for the transaction, we can rapidly scale across desired markets globally.

We need people and communities who can put up with a not so-good experience in early days, so that it becomes seamless for masses to adopt the technology as Opoch evolves. 

We will keep innovating till every new user who joins the bandwagon, feels delighted at the technology and experience. Something, that we believe is fundamental in driving adoption at scale.

Join us in building this exciting future.
