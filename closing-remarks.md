# Closing Remarks

We are building Opoch so that whenever someone asks you, '_What is Bitcoin?_'' or '_What are Cryptocurrencies_?', you just have to redirect them to downloading the Opoch app, and we'll do out best to have one more individual on the Crypto bandwagon.

Opoch is being built as the breeding ground of community evangelists. The early pioneers would be people who believe enough in Cryptocurrencies to work with not so great experience today, for the rewards of tomorrow.
