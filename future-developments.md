# Milestones

~~The cryptocurrency ecosystem is fairly nascent but evolving at great pace. To create the necessary network effect around Opoch app, it would be needed to provide other services on the same mobile app as it might require in the future. We plan to work with the teams and developers working on different protocols to provide these services on out platform.~~

~~Out of the many use-cases possible in future, few of the use-cases can be a community created ICO marketplace, margin trading on cryptocurrency etc. The Opoch tokens can be used to govern these platforms.~~

~~Some or all of these services might require user identity verification as per local regulations. We would use uPort as identity solution when the need arises.~~
