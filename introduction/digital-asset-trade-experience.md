# Entering Crypto Ecosystem

### Digital Asset Trade Experience

Markets work on demand and supply. For eg. Somebody in your country right now is selling Bitcoin at market price. Somebody in your country is willing to pay for it. Unfortunately in all probability, both side of this exchange would be interacting with a 3rd party intermediary, like a centralized exchange in most cases and not directly with each other. We wish to change that.

The experience of trading or using cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner at par if not better from centralized solutions, if we are to expect the larger masses to use them. Thus, time taken by a user in the process of purchasing these assets needs to be minimized.

#### Purchasing Process Time

In simple terms, the time required in purchasing process can be broken down into 2 parts. 

1. Search and discovery
2. Transfer of assets

For example, 

For __**Physical Assets:** Transferring \(shipping\) physical assets bought online is more time consuming than the discovery of the same right now. That's why 1-day delivery, 2-hour delivery is what excites the consumer and adoption most. This ever improving experience has driven e-commerce adoption to levels that has crushed the traditional retail industry\[32\]~~.~~

> What's not going to change in 10 years? Because you can build a business strategy around things that are not going to change. For example, '_I love Amazon; I just wish you'd deliver a little more slowly'_, nobody is going to say that in the next 10 years. Therefore, we can focus on making sure we keep improving our delivery times.

For **Crypto Assets:** Transfer of Assets: Lightning network, Plasma and upcoming scalable technologies in development, help to **transfer digital assets** instantly. As stated above, it's one part of the total purchase time, but experience also fundamentally depends on the time of search and discovery of the digital asset.

_Centralized exchanges_ that hold consumer digital assets in their order books can do **search and discovery** of trade instantaneously, but due to their systemic risks and safety issues, are inappropriate for mass adoption.

Opoch solves **search and discovery** via marketplace model so that peers can exchange fiat currency for digital assets in a decentralized manner.

To minimize the search and discovery time in a decentralized manner requires two key components:

* Product
* Community \(Network Effects\)

**Product:** To reduce this search and discovery time in a P2P marketplace is one of the first challenges for Opoch to solve. This is must as communication between peers need to be instantaneous for a great user experience.

We realize this cannot be done via emails or desktops, where there is a delay in communication, rather by being closer to the user, on their smartphones. By being mobile first, Opoch reduces this delay of communication and enables a seamless experience for the next billion.

In the current scenario, _the experience of doing this P2P trade is like trying to use Uber in a world of Desktops and emails_.

**Community**: Marketplaces fundamentally require early pioneering community. It must have users at both ends of the market, such that we are able to create the experience of trading digital assets, as compared to centralized exchanges.

Thankfully, **OPOC tokens** allow us to appreciate and reward the early pioneers for their endeavours. We need people and communities that are willing to put up with a not so-good experience in early days, so that we can unlock the upcoming wave of mass adoption.
