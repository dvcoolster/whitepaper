# Storing and Interacting with Digital Assets

## **Security and Safety**

In the information age, wars are being fought with scammers and hackers before tanks and missiles. 

On the personal level, **individual security** is of paramount importance in a tokenised world. Losing your keys or having them stolen can be catastrophic. Being afraid to handle private keys is also one of the reasons ordinary user might prefer to keep his assets in centralised locations. But, as time has proven they're prone to hacks and failures.

_Remembering 12 word mnemonic keys is not user friendly._ 

We must make the process easier and secure to hold and interact with digital assets.

### Mobile and Individuality

Mobile devices are personal to most individuals. Therefore, they make it much safer to hold digital assets securely. We will keep innovating and utilise the best existing technologies, such as _touchID_ and _FaceID_ to keep assets further secure from any unauthorised access. 

Being mobile first, allows us to be bold in innovation for the challenge of driving mass scale adoption of Digital assets.

### Private Keys

Mobile gives us new ways to look at the challenge. That is why Opoch has powerful features such as Social Recovery of Private Keys, a multi-currency cross platform wallet that never touches your private keys and lets you use your assets over the internet using signed transactions.

### Signing Transactions

A key feature of blockchain technology is owning identity over the internet. Currency is the first application of it. With the help of APIs on Opoch's Platform any developer can raise an intent, and user can simply use Opoch to sign the transaction. The signed transaction is sent over the internet by Opoch to the desired service. 

This allows us to open Opoch as a platform for all developers to build experiences for users, while still keeping the security intact.
