# Storing Digital Assets

In the information age, the real battles are being fought with scammers and hackers rather than tanks and missiles. Safety and security are of paramount importance in the tokenized world for mass adoption.

### Centralized System Risks 

Today, most users have their digital assets stored in **centralized systems,** which are insecure and have a single point of failure. They have witnessed loss of funds via hacks, malicious activities, etc.\[33\] These events have inhibited growth of user trust and adoption.

At its core, Opoch has a decentralized multi-currency cross platform wallet. This makes sure users hold their assets in their own hands, and therefore are completely secure from such risks or attacks.

### Private Keys Safety

The storing of crypto assets in decentralized wallets, where private keys are generated and stored in the device itself, has a fair share of concerns around it. Losing private keys and mnemonic phrase subsequently makes funds inaccessible which is a bad user experience compared to traditional systems of password or account recovery. 

Opoch's social recovery mechanism allows the user to restore his/her private keys via interacting with a set of friends and network.

### Multiple Crypto Assets

As Crypto ecosystem continues to evolve, demand and usage of various crypto assets continue to rise. This presents a scenario where a user holding several digital assets across blockchains is required to use multiple wallets. This presents a unique challenge for simplifying adoption at scale. Opoch aims to solve this by providing a multi-currency wallet with a single master-seed thereby making it convenient for a user to handle all his/her digital assets.
