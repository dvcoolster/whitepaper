# Utility of Digital Assets

Buying and storing of digital assets securely is required for the dawn of Opoch Age. But, their utility must become mainstream for the true unveiling of possibilities. We believe that this requires the community to come and build together. The masses would be excited by the diverse possibilities that this ecosystem brings to all. 

We are building Opoch in an open and modular structure allowing us to empower developers and businesses with powerful APIs on our open platform so as to kick-start their projects swiftly, without spending resources on common infrastructure challenges that Opoch has solved for all. 

### Living on Cryptocurrencies 

Unfortunately, currently there's no city in the world where you can live on cryptocurrencies on a regular basis. In all cities, everyone can, and does live on fiat currencies. We are taking a big leap on making it convenient to switch between the two at all times. Thus, enabling one to hold his/her wealth in form of cryptocurrencies, yet being able to live freely in regular world using fiat currencies.

### Future Commerce

Fiat currencies are centralized asset that are important for functioning of governments and society at large. We believe the technology and community used to enable fiat-to-crypto transactions in a peer-to-peer manner, will also be used to enable new markets, wherein one may offer services and products in exchange of digital assets.

The possibilities that are unlocked when larger masses have adopted cryptocurrencies are colossal. New economic opportunities that are not possible in traditional financial systems would be one of the key factors that lead to adoption of decentralized technology.

### Bridging Token Ecosystem

Distributed file storage, prediction markets, distributed video encodingetc. are but a few of the utilities that are being built in web 3.0. Most of them are being built as self-sustaining ecosystems having their own unique tokens for the niche service or utility they provide.\[35\]

The Opoch platform with its integrated decentralized exchange will empower developers, to use these tokens seamlessly to build applications. From a user point of view, s/he will hold assets in desired cryptocurrencies and inter-conversion between tokens, required to use these applications, would be handled by the platform.

Thus, Opoch will drive adoption by creating a seamless ecosystem for developers to build applications, and allowing users to use these applications, without worrying about what goes on in background.

### Payments

Cryptocurrencies enable global commerce, but technical challenges inhibit traditional businesses from taking part in it. In the current scenario, whether it be a one-time transaction like e-commerce, or subscription services like Netflix, the challenges for accepting cryptocurrencies in various payments schemes remain unsolved.

Opoch enables businesses to accept cryptocurrencies as desired effortlessly. For users, Opoch provides larger control over their business relationships via accessing all their subscriptions from the one single smart-contract. This can also be accessed without using Opoch, giving user complete sovereignty.

Micro payments, global instant transactions and immutability are incentivizing entrepreneurs to innovate and build new business models that aren't possible in traditional financial systems. Opoch is building tools and infrastructure that connects users and businesses in new found ways, actuating existing industries such as modern journalism and several others.
