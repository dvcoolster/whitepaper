# Utility of Digital Assets

What drives the value of Cryptocurrencies in the longterm? _Adoption_. 

According to the general perception, increase in prices correspond to increase in adoption. Increase in prices results in media hype and awareness, that results in increased adoption, but It's paramount to understand that _longterm value of cryptocurrencies will be derived from their usage and utility at scale._

The more people use cryptocurrencies on a regular basis, more valuable the ecosystem as a whole becomes, thus reflecting the same in market capitalisations. Let us take a deeper look into current and future status of adoption.

### Living on Cryptocurrencies

Unfortunately, there's no city in the world where you can live on cryptocurrencies on a regular basis right now. In all cities, everyone can, and does live on fiat currencies. We are taking a big push on making it convenient to switch between the two at all times. Thus, enabling one to hold his wealth in cryptocurrencies, yet being able to live freely in regular world using fiat currencies. 

This does help increase the utility, but no where close to what the future demands. 

### Enabling Businesses

We believe solving user's problems is a key part of the story, but we must enable businesses to accept and transact in cryptocurrencies to complete the ecosystem at scale. In order to facilitate smooth payments we need to provide solutions to existing as well as new businesses so that they can easily integrate cryptocurrencies in their payment schemes.

Opoch is building developer APIs that creates Smart Contracts for accepting seamless global payments in various payment schemes by any business globally.

This in turn will help Opoch complete the user adoption cycle right from entering the crypto ecosystem, to storing the digital assets and utilising them conveniently at scale.
