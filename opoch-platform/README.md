# Opoch Products

With the described problems in mind, Opoch aims to solve these problems with an array of products or services for each user or party in mind.

Our first product is **Opoch Mobile App**, which we envision will help onboard the next billion cryptocurrency users and become the go-to application for them to interact with the decentralised technology. Two fundamental features of Opoch are

* Decentralised Fiat-Crypto P2P Marketplace which enables users to buy/sell cryptocurrency at ease. This is powered by a multi-currency, cross-platform decentralised wallet which allows users to store digital crypto-assets without relying on any third party. 
* Decentralised P2P exchange \(DEX\) which allows conversion of alternative cryptocurrencies instantly and facilitate altcoin trading on a distributed ledger.  

Our second product is **Opoch Payments** where are building ****developer APIs that create Smart Contracts for accepting seamless global payments for any business in various payment schemes. In order to complete the adoption cycle, we must enable businesses to accept payments for their services/products in cryptocurrencies.
