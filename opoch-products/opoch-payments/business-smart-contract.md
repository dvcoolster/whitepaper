# Business Smart Contract

With the evolution of internet and internet commerce, the type business model for payments has become quite complicated. A simple request of payment for one time payments does not work for most of these use-cases.

While generating smart-contract business can provide parameters for the type of payments \(One-time payment/ Opt-out subscription/ Opt-in subscription/ Escrows\), and in case of different tier plans in case of subscription.

Once the smart-contract is generated the smart-contract address can be used to enable payments for that specific business. The payment details \(user details, payment done, services offered etc.\) can be stored on the centralized services as done today or it can be stored on IPFS.
