# Token \(OPCH\)

The Opoch Token, or OPCH, is the native token of the Opoch. Participation requires a user to possess OPCHs. Those that do not are incentivized to earn OPCHs by engaging in activities that contribute to the health of the ecosystem. As with all ERC20 tokens, OPCHs will be tradeable following the crowd sale \(details in annexure\).

The OPCH has been envisioned for a  
three-fold objective: to lubricate process and drive utility on the protocol;  
to incentivize participation; to empower governance.

### Utility Toll

To quote Ethereum Foundation  
advisor William Mougayar, ““...there needs to be a specific linkage between  
user actions and the resulting effects of those actions on the overall value to  
the organization.” The OPCH enables utility and lubricates process on the protocol.
